this will containe the if statement and it will be used by building the Rock Paper and Scissors 
console.log Math.random; 
The Math.random() static method returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number that's greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1, with approximately uniform distribution over that range
we are going to save the Math.random into a variable so that we can use it again.
ways that we can use to Convert the random number into a move we have to use an example like we have one line which is from 0 to 1 divide it into

three parts, every part will have 1/3 and each part will be called rock, paper and scissors
because they will give computer the chance to pick R, P and S. we are gonna need to use the If statement 

Logocal operators helps us to combine the booleans values 
examples of logical operators

console.log(true && true); this is called the AND operator and it checks if two booleans values

scope: limits where a variable exists, scope also help us to avoid naming conflicts
for example in if statement (the variable we create inside the curly brackets we can't use those variable outside the curly brackets or they can not affect the outside codes) that's is called a scope

so we have to create a variable outside the scope in order to access it
